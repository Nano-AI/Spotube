## Todo

- Get the actual thing done
- Maybe use framer motion? (maybe with NavLink selection?)
- Import playlists with files (include draggable files)
- Make window look better (rounded edges, better titlebar)
- Add minimum window size
- Add search channels
- Search playlists
- Filter for songs only (?)
- Make search bar it's own component
- Fix inconsistent naming in code
- Make code more readable
- Align the "Top result" with the songs
- Setup global styles (like for song and artist names)
- Cleaner Tailwind Config file
- Make it so it's based off of a template, everything shouldn't have it's own color
